<h3>Class schedule for Wednesdays description list</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>Writing</dt>
  <dd><p>The first class of the day, this class is pretty easy going. Homework is due each class, though.</p></dd>
  <dt>Chinese history</dt>
  <dd><p>Also a rather chill class, and arguably tying for the most interesting. Only has pop quizzes so far.</p></dd>
  <dt>Programming languages</dt>
  <dd><p>The most difficult class of <b>Wednesdays</b>, it is challenging in a fun way, but a weird glitch with parsing messed up my last homework submission.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>This prevented the actual verification of the last part of the homework as being correct.</li>

  I'm         not really        sure what to put
      as the placeholder            for the 'pre' type text
                  so have this
</pre>
<div class="an aside">
  <p>this text isn't particularly relevant, which is why it's in a div.</p>
  <p>the first part also goes for the text <span class ="telephone number">1800-RUSLAPPIN</span>, which is put under span, since it's not described by any other inline element/</p>
